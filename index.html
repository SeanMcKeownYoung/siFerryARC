                The Staten Island Ferry, a critical link to Manhattan, used to be known as one of the most reliable forms of mass transit in New York City. Yet ongoing schedule reductions have upended riders, who can no longer depend on the 24-hour ferry service. So what's to blame? The factors range from strict licensing requirements, to labor disputes, short staffing and, in some people's mind, a lack of urgency by the city. </p>
